        <h2>Question of the Month: Why do you love formula 1?</h2>
        <p>“The emotions behind every race and driver, that's one thing to love, but mostly the passion of every driver in every race.”</p>
        <p>“It‘s all about lovely people, fans, engineers, drivers and more who share the same passion.”</p>
        <p>“It's full of passion from all sides - drivers, teams, fans - and while there's rivalry there's also respect. You learn to expect the unexpected on a race weekend, which makes for intrigue and excitement. Plus the drivers I've met have been lovely and had time for their fans.”</p>
        <p>​“The speed and beauty of the cars, the bravery of the drivers, the history and the heroes but most of all the work done by the whole team”</p>
